        <h2>Perfect Creamy Scrambled Eggs</h2>
        <p>
            This recipe makes perfect scrambled eggs that are super soft 
            and creamy. A quality non-stick pan and silicone spatula are 
            really useful. It's important that you use low heat and don't 
            forget about the chance of carryover cooking. Eggs are 
            delicate and cook very quickly. I like to take the pan off of 
            the heat before the scramble has finished cooking. Give the 
            eggs a few seconds in the hot pan (off the heat) and you'll 
            find the eggs turn out to be perfectly cooked â€” not dry, and 
            not too wet.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 large eggs</li>
            <li>1/8 teaspoon kosher salt, or more to taste</li>
            <li>1/2 tablespoon butter or olive oil</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Melt the butter in a medium non-stick pan over medium-low heat.</li>
            <li>Crack eggs into a bowl, add a pinch of salt and whisk 
                until well blended. Let sit for 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>When the butter begins to bubble, pour in the eggs and 
                immediately use a silicone spatula to swirl in small 
                circles around the pan, without stopping, until the eggs 
                look slightly thickened and very small curds begin to form, 
                about 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>Change from making circles to making long sweeps across 
                the pan until you see larger, creamy curds, about 20 
                seconds.</li>
            <li>When the eggs are softly set and slightly runny in places, 
                remove the pan from the heat and leave for a few seconds to 
                finish cooking. Give a final stir and serve immediately. 
                Serve with an extra sprinkle of salt, a grind of black 
                pepper and a few fresh chopped herbs (if desired).</li>
        </ol>
